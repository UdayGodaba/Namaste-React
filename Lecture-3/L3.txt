-> React.createElement will create an object with specified HTML tag, attributes and children.
-> root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")) any changes inside react code will be visible on specified root.
-> root.render() is going to replace everything in the specified tag with the react element passed.
-> When the react element is rendered onto the DOM then it is converted to HTMLElement.

-> JSX is HTML like syntax.
-> JSX makes easier to write code instead of React.createElement.
-> JSX is not directly understood by JS Engine.
-> JSX is transpiled before it reaches the JS Engine and it is done by Babel package.
-> JSX --> React.createElement(JS object) --> HTMLElement(after rendered).
-> In JSX we use camelcase for writing attributes.
-> In case of multiple lines of JSX wrap inside brackets.
-> Inside JSX we can write JS within curly brackets.
-> One more super feature of JSX is it takes care of cross site scripting attacks.

-> Functional Component is a JS function returning some JSX.
-> Component name should start with capital case.
-> Inorder to render components wrap component inside <ComponentName />.
-> Component composition is nothing but writing a component inside other component or combining smaller reusable components.
-> We can club React element and components in anyway.
